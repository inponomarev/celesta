//tag::basic_terms[]

Score:: entirety of database schemas used in the given instance of Celesta, presented as <<CelestaSQL>> scripts.

<<CelestaSQL>> script:: text file containing information on
. database schemas.
Note: due to historical reasons, "schema" in Celesta is synonym to "grain".
. tables, including information on
.. fields and their types (subset of valid types selection allows for universal support in all supported database types)
.. table primary key â€“ it is necessary for operation of <<data_accessors_section,data access classes>>,
.. `DEFAULT` field values,
.. `NOT NULL` field restrictions,
. indices,
. sequences,
. foreign keys,
. views, including materialized views and functions.

In the course of <<maven_plugin_section,Celesta Maven Plugin>> work the data access classes are generated on the basis of these script and files themselves are copied to the resources of the compiled jar files.

Database schema automatic upgrade to the type set in CelestaSQL scripts happens at the launch of Celesta.


Schema version tag:: version ID in the form of a list of components separated with commas, explicitly provided by the grain developer in the grain script <<version_tags,`CREATE GRAIN ... VERSION ...`>> command.
It protects from unintentional automatic database downgrade at the launch of an older version grain with a newer version database.
Automatic database upgrade never takes place if the database version tag is higher than the grain script version tag or the versions do not align.

Grain checksum:: automatically calculated grain script checksum.
Helps to differentiate CelestaSQL scripts by their contents.
CelestaSQL scripts with identical version tags might intentionally (during development) or unintentionally (due to developer's carelessness) have different contents.
Database created automatically using grain creation script not only has a version tag, but also contains a grain creation script checksum to give an opportunity to track the moment it was contacted by an application with an altered grain metadescription.
Simultaneous match of a version tag and a grain checksum is enough to continue operation without trying to upgrade the database structure. To simplify verification and ensure the algorithm transparency, the checksum consists of two values: the script file length (written down as a decimal integer) and its https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check#CRC-32_algorithm[CRC32] (written down as eight hexadecimal integers).

Celesta system grain:: Special grain with an unchangeable table structure.
This grain's tables are used for the system's internal needs.
At the same time, recording and editing the data in some of these tables are standard procedures during system configuration.
See the "celesta" grain description in the <<system_tables>> section.

Celesta.grains table:: Celesta central system table of the database.
Existence of the table indicates that Celesta is connected to the corresponding database, otherwise it will try to create one from scratch.
The table contains information on state of grains in the database.
Field description can be found in the <<celesta_grains_table,Celesta System Tables>> section.
Information from this table is used extensively during <<startup_sequence,startup sequence>>.

Grain startup sequence:: <<startup_sequence,Sequences>> executed by Celesta for every grain on startup.
The database migrates automatically if necessary and possible.

Database automatic migration:: Part of startup sequence, involving comparing the existing database structure to Celesta score set by grain creation scripts.
After comparing, the differences are eliminated with automatically created and executed CREATE/ALTER commands.

Data access class (cursor):: Class, generated automatically on the basis of CelestaSQL script, used for interaction with table, view and sequence data.
