https://github.com/CourseOrchestra/celesta[Celesta] is a tool for Java backend developers who want easier ways to deliver RDBMS-backed software.

This is a Java library with a Maven plugin that provides database migrations, ORM and testing.

Unlike, for instance, Hibernate + Liquibase, Celesta does not require one to keep in mind the schema design and migrations separately, and provides a fast and lightweight way to unit-test the code that works with the database.

It can be used by adding a https://search.maven.org/search?q=a:celesta-parent[Maven dependency] to your project, and it also has its own https://github.com/CourseOrchestra/spring-boot-starter-celesta[Spring Boot starter].

= Main Features

. *Independence from database type.* Solutions created in Celesta can be transferred between all supported databases without losing functionality.
We support the following types of RDBMS and try to do it in the most transparent manner possible (the list is not final):
 ** MS SQL Server;
 ** Oracle;
 ** Postgre SQL;
 ** H2;
 ** Firebird (beta).

. *Database-first data structure design.* Celesta is used to design tables, views and connections between them first instead of classes, which are generated automatically.
. *Database structure automatic migration* based on https://dzone.com/articles/trouble-free-database-migration-idempotence-and-co[idempotent DDL].
. Simplified *unit testing*: quick tests of code that interacts with the database, based on H2 database in-memory operation mode.
. Automatically generated intermediary access layer for tables to create business logic based on the database structure.
. Application interaction with an existing database (application integration via database).
. Permissions management.
. Data changes auditing.
